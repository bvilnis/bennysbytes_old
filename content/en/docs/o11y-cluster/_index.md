# Overview
This wiki guide will walk you through the process of setting up a local Kubernetes cluster using k3d and deploying the Grafana Stack (Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, and Grafana) using Helm charts on both macOS and Linux systems. The Grafana Stack provides comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing capabilities, which can be easily managed and visualised through the Grafana dashboard.
