## Preparing for Usenet: Providers and Indexers

Before we begin configuring the media server applications, it's essential to understand the roles of Usenet providers and indexers in our media stack. In this guide, we will be using [Newshosting](https://www.newshosting.com) as our Usenet provider and [NZBGeek](https://nzbgeek.info) as our indexer, but feel free to explore other options that may better suit your needs.

### Usenet Provider: Newshosting

A Usenet provider, such as Newshosting, is your gateway to Usenet. It allows you to connect and download content from Usenet servers. Newshosting is renowned for its high connection speeds, reliable access, and secure downloads with SSL encryption. 

To use Newshosting:

1. Visit the Newshosting website [here](https://www.newshosting.com/).
2. Choose a plan that suits your needs and sign up for an account.
3. Keep your Newshosting account information on hand, as you'll need it in the next section when configuring the media applications.

Remember, a subscription to Newshosting or another Usenet provider is necessary to download content from Usenet.

### Usenet Indexer: NZBGeek

An NZB indexer, such as NZBGeek, is essentially a search engine for Usenet. It indexes and helps you find NZB files, which are files used to download content from Usenet. NZBGeek is known for its wide range of indexed content and its reliability.

To use NZBGeek:

1. Visit the NZBGeek website [here](https://nzbgeek.info/).
2. Register for an account.
3. Keep your NZBGeek account information on hand for the next section.

Note that most NZB indexers, including NZBGeek, require a membership fee for full access to their NZB files.

Now that you have your Usenet provider and indexer accounts ready, we can proceed to the next section, where we'll install  the media server applications.
