{{< blocks/cover title="About Me" image_anchor="top" height="full" >}}

<p class="text-left">
I grew up with a keyboard and mouse in my hand, and it wasn't just because I was born in the tech boom of the 90s. My dad was a tech entrepreneur, and he started a computer store, an internet service provider, and a hosting company throughout the late 20th century. That's how I first fell in love with computer technology.
</br></br>
During my teenage years, I tinkered with computers for the family business, which led me to start building and hosting websites on my own. Fast forward to today, and I've worked in a variety of engineering roles throughout my career.
</br></br>
I've implemented environmental telemetry solutions for Australia's largest mines, worked on lifting and shifting on-premises servers to cloud environments, and built and automated composable infrastructure platforms at scale. Most recently, I've been working in the SRE and observability space for both a unicorn scale-up and now, a multinational public company.
</br></br>
But I'm not just a tech geek. In my free time, I'm an accomplished musician and a volunteer firefighter for the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. I've also rediscovered my love for writing and social commentary, and I've started creating content under the name "<a href="https://bennysbanter.com" target="_blank" style="color: #68cfff;">Benny's Banter</a>." Through this platform, I delve into topics like self-improvement, philosophy, history, and current events and culture.
</br></br>
In all aspects of my life, I strive to learn and grow, whether it's through technology, music, firefighting, or writing. I believe that life is about constantly pushing ourselves to be better and to make a positive impact in the world. Whether it's through my professional work or my personal pursuits, I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and to make a difference.
