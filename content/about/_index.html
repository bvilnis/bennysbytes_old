<p class="text-left">
Ben grew up around computers from a young age. His father started a computer store, an internet service provider, and a hosting company throughout the '90s and early '00s. Ben quickly found his affinity for computer technology throughout this time and started tinkering with computers for the family business, leading him to build and host websites during high school.
</br></br>
Skip forward a decade and a half, and Ben has worked in various technology companies. His career has included working on environmental telemetry data solutions, the lift 'n' shift of on-premises servers to cloud environments, implementing automated and composable infrastructure-as-code at scale, and, most recently, in the SRE and observability space for both a unicorn scale-up and multinational company.
</br></br>
Away from computers, Ben is an accomplished musician and serves as a volunteer firefighter in the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. He has also recently reconnected with his aptitude for writing and social commentary and has started creating content under "<a href="https://bennysbanter.com" target="_blank" style="color: #68cfff;">Benny's Banter</a>", where he deals with topics such as self-improvement, philosophy, history, and the events and culture of today's world.
