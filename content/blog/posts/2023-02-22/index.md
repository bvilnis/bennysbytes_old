  As we all shift into high gear for 2023 and get cracking on our roadmaps and deliverables, I want to share some fundamental principles I have picked up over the years for putting together kick-ass teams and smashing goals. Some of the following tenets became evident to me out in the wild, while others were taught to me by some truly great engineers and leaders.

  Embrace constraints: Contrary to popular belief, constraints can be a powerful tool to help you focus and be more creative. Instead of waiting for the perfect circumstances or the perfect product, start with what you have and use it to your advantage.

  **Keep it simple:** Complex systems and processes can be overwhelming and hinder productivity. Simplify your workflow, eliminate unnecessary steps, and focus on what matters most.

  **Do less:** More isn't always better. So instead of trying to do everything, focus on doing a few things well. Doing so will help you build a strong foundation and avoid burnout.

  **Be opinionated:** Take a stand and have a clear point of view on what you do and why you do it. This will help you attract like-minded people who share your vision and values.

  **Avoid distractions:** Multitasking, meetings, and interruptions can be significant distractions and destroy your flow state. Instead, schedule focus time to work on your most important tasks and minimize interruptions.

  **Start small:** Don't wait for everything to be perfect before you launch. Instead, start small, iterate, and adjust along the way. This will help you learn and improve quickly and avoid wasting time and resources.

  **Focus on customers:** Customers—internal and external—are the lifeblood of any product or service. Listen to their feedback, be responsive, and build products and services that solve their problems.

  **Hire the right people:** Hire people who share your values and vision and have the necessary skills and experience. Hiring the right people will help build a strong team that is aligned and motivated to achieve shared goals.

  I hope you found some wisdom and inspiration in these seemingly simple principles that are often overlooked or dismissed. Now, let's get out there and smash our goals for 2023!
